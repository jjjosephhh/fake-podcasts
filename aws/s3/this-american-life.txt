Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to "This American Life", the podcast that tells stories about ordinary people and their extraordinary experiences. Today, we are going to take a deep dive into the world of cloud storage, and we are going to do it by exploring one of the most popular services out there. Amazon Ess Three. Now, you might be wondering what Amazon Ess Three is, and why we are devoting an entire episode to it. Well, for starters, Ess Three stands for Simple Storage Service, and it is basically a massive digital storage space that Amazon provides to individuals, businesses, and organizations. It is like a virtual warehouse, but instead of physical goods, it stores data. everything from photos, videos, and music, to business documents, databases, and backups. The thing is, Ess Three is not just any ordinary storage service. it is the backbone of the internet. It is the place where many of the world's most popular websites, apps, and services store their data, so that it can be accessed quickly and reliably from anywhere in the world. In fact, according to recent estimates, Ess Three stores trillions of objects and serves over 100 billion requests per month. that's a lot of data! So, why do people and businesses use Ess Three? Well, for starters, it is incredibly reliable and secure. Amazon has built Ess Three with multiple layers of redundancy and backups, so that even if one data center goes down, your data will still be safe and accessible. Plus, Ess Three is designed to be scalable, so you can store as much or as little data as you need, and only pay for what you use. It is like having your own virtual storage closet, but without the hassle of maintenance and upgrades. But, like any good story, there's a catch. Despite its reliability and security, Ess Three has had its fair share of mishaps and outages. In fact, in 2017, an engineer at Amazon made a simple typo that caused a massive outage across the internet. Thousands of websites, apps, and services were affected, causing chaos and frustration for millions of users. It was a stark reminder of how much we rely on the internet, and how even the smallest mistakes can have huge consequences. But, despite the occasional hiccup, Ess Three remains a vital part of the internet, powering everything from online shopping and streaming, to social media and data analysis. And, like any good episode of "This American Life", it is a reminder that even the most mundane things in our lives. like cloud storage. can have a profound impact on the world around us. So, the next time you upload a photo to the cloud or stream a video, remember that you are tapping into a vast network of storage, servers, and data centers. and that it is all thanks to services like Amazon Ess Three.
